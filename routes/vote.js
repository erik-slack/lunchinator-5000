    // I spoke with my team lead about my concerns 
    // and there were no good reasons for the things I was disputing
    // and he or she consented to some changes to their initial plan.
    // Namely, those changes are posts should not use queryParams instead of the body
    // and all queries should return something, be they successful or not.
    // Also it might be better to store this with a key as a guid to protect sensitive information.
